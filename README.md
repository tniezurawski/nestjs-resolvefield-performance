## Issue reproduction

0. Set up the project

```
yarn install
```

1. Start the server

```
yarn start:dev
```

2. Go to the playground - http://localhost:3000/graphql
3. Run the `products` query:

```gql
query Products {
  products {
    id
    direct
    resolved
    combined
    parent
  }
}
```

10 000 products will be returned. You can adjust the number in `src/products/products.mock.ts` file.

Notes about fields:
 - `id` and `direct` are passed directly from the REST response, no resolver involved
 - `resolved` field is being resolved through a resolver, but a very simple one. Just pointing to the REST field (1:1)
 - `combined` field has a resolver that concatenates two fields (think about it as "full name" that's created from first and last name fields)
 - `parent` same as `resolved` but uses `@Parent()` decorator

4. Run the `products` query with just a single field case to understand its impact


## My findings

### Methodology

In each case, I run a simple query with `id` and "a field". Here's the k6 command I used:

```
k6 run --vus 1 --duration 30s --http-debug ./performance/--CASE--.js
```

### `direct`

This is the baseline. 1353 requests in 30s:

### `resolved`

`resolved` field is a 1:1 map to a field (from another service response or database). 582 requests in 30s. **That's a 57% degradation in performance!** Or in other words, not using a resolver is 2.3x faster.

### `parent`

Same as `resolved` but also uses `@Parent` decorator. 346 requests in 30s. **That's a ~75% drop in performance!** Or in other words, the base is 3.9x faster than a resolver that happens to use the `@Parent` decorator.
